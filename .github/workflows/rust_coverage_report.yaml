# This workflow runs in the context of the base repository after the
# "Rust Test" workflow completes. It downloads the coverage artifact
# and posts the coverage report as a PR comment. This two-workflow
# approach is necessary because fork PRs do not receive write
# permissions on the GITHUB_TOKEN.
