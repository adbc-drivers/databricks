  - id: SESSION-001
    name: Basic OpenSession Success
    priority: Critical
    description: |
      Validates that driver can successfully open a session with valid credentials
      and receives a valid session handle.

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Open a new session with valid credentials
        thrift_call: OpenSession

    assertions:
      - type: no_error
        description: OpenSession completes without error

      - type: thrift_call_count
        method: OpenSession
        expected: 1
        description: Driver called OpenSession exactly once

      - type: session_handle_valid
        description: Session handle is not null and properly formatted

    notes: |
      This is the most basic test. All other session tests depend on this working.

  - id: SESSION-002
    name: CloseSession on Active Session
    priority: Critical
    description: |
      Validates that driver can successfully close an active session and
      properly cleans up resources.

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Open session, then close it
        thrift_calls:
          - OpenSession
          - CloseSession

    assertions:
      - type: no_error
        description: CloseSession completes without error

      - type: thrift_call_count
        method: CloseSession
        expected: 1
        description: Driver called CloseSession exactly once

    notes: |
      Driver should release all resources associated with the session.

  - id: SESSION-003
    name: Operation on Closed Session
    priority: Critical
    description: |
      Validates that driver properly handles attempts to use a session handle
      after the session has been closed.

    jira: ES-610899
    proxy_scenario: invalid_session_handle

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Open session, close it, then attempt to execute statement
        thrift_calls:
          - OpenSession
          - CloseSession
          - ExecuteStatement

    assertions:
      - type: error_thrown
        error_type: InvalidSessionHandle
        description: Driver throws appropriate error for invalid session

    notes: |
      Driver must detect closed session and fail gracefully rather than
      sending request to server with invalid handle.

  - id: SESSION-004
    name: Session Timeout Due to Inactivity
    priority: High
    description: |
      Validates that driver handles session timeout when session idle timeout
      is exceeded without activity.

    proxy_scenario: session_timeout_premature
    jira: ES-1661289

    driver_config:
      session_idle_timeout_minutes: 1

    steps:
      - action: establish_baseline
        description: Open session and execute query
        execute_query: "SELECT 1"

    assertions:
      - type: error_thrown
        error_type: SessionExpired
        description: Driver detects session expiration

      - type: thrift_call_count
        method: OpenSession
        expected: baseline_open_session_count + 1
        description: Driver opens new session after detecting expiration

    notes: |
      Driver should detect session expiration and either:
      1. Throw clear error to user, OR
      2. Automatically create new session (if auto-reconnect enabled)

  - id: SESSION-005
    name: CloseSession with Active Operations
    priority: High
    description: |
      Validates driver behavior when CloseSession is called while
      operations are still running.

    jira: XTA-11040
    proxy_scenario: session_close_with_active_operations

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Start long-running query, then immediately close session
        execute_query: "SELECT * FROM large_table"
        close_immediately: true

    assertions:
      - type: operations_cancelled
        description: All active operations are cancelled

      - type: thrift_call_count
        method: CancelOperation
        expected: ">= 1"
        description: Driver cancels active operations before closing

      - type: no_error
        description: CloseSession completes successfully

    notes: |
      Driver should cancel all active operations before closing session.
      This prevents resource leaks on the server.

  - id: SESSION-006
    name: Session Handle Reuse After Close
    priority: Medium
    description: |
      Validates that driver prevents reuse of session handle after CloseSession.

    jira: ES-1608485
    proxy_scenario: session_handle_reuse_after_close

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Close session, save handle, attempt to reuse
        thrift_calls:

    assertions:
      - type: error_thrown
        error_type: InvalidSessionHandle
        description: Driver rejects closed session handle

    notes: |
      Driver should track session state and prevent operations on closed sessions.

      - type: thrift_call_count
        method: OpenSession
        expected: 2
        description: Driver opened two separate sessions

      - type: sessions_independent
        description: Operations on one session don't affect the other

    notes: |
      Each session should have independent state and operation tracking.

  - id: SESSION-008
    name: OpenSession with Configuration Parameters
    priority: High
    description: |
      Validates that driver correctly passes session configuration parameters
      to OpenSession request.

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Open session with custom configuration
        session_config:

        description: Session opens successfully

      - type: session_config_applied
        description: Configuration parameters are sent to server

    notes: |
      Driver should include configuration map in OpenSession request.

  - id: SESSION-009
    name: GetInfo on Valid Session
    priority: Medium
    description: |
      Validates that driver can retrieve server information using GetInfo
      on an active session.

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Open session and call GetInfo
        thrift_calls:
          - OpenSession
          - GetInfo

    assertions:
      - type: no_error
        description: GetInfo completes successfully

      - type: info_response_valid
        description: GetInfo returns valid server information

    notes: |
      GetInfo provides server version, capabilities, and configuration.

  - id: SESSION-010
    name: Session with Expired Credentials
    priority: High
    description: |
      Validates that driver handles OpenSession failure due to
      expired authentication credentials.

    proxy_scenario: expired_credentials

    steps:
      - action: enable_failure_scenario
        scenario: expired_credentials

      - action: execute_test
        description: Attempt to open session with expired token
        thrift_call: OpenSession

    assertions:
      - type: error_thrown
        error_type: AuthenticationFailed
        description: Driver reports authentication failure

    notes: |
      Driver should provide clear error message about expired credentials.

  - id: SESSION-011
    name: OpenSession Network Timeout
    priority: Medium
    description: |
      Validates that driver handles network timeout during OpenSession request.

    proxy_scenario: network_timeout_open_session

    steps:
      - action: enable_failure_scenario
        scenario: network_timeout_open_session
        config:
          duration_seconds: 35  # Exceeds 30s timeout

      - action: execute_test
        description: Attempt to open session with network delay
        thrift_call: OpenSession

    assertions:
      - type: error_thrown
        error_type: Timeout
        description: Driver reports timeout error

      - type: retry_attempted
        description: Driver retries OpenSession with exponential backoff

    notes: |
      Driver should retry transient network failures with backoff.

  - id: SESSION-012
    name: CloseSession Network Failure
    priority: Low
    description: |
      Validates that driver handles network failure during CloseSession
      and still cleans up local resources.

    proxy_scenario: network_failure_close_session

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Open session, enable failure, then close
        thrift_calls:
          - OpenSession
          - CloseSession  # will fail

    assertions:
      - type: local_resources_cleaned
        description: Driver releases local resources despite network failure

    notes: |
      CloseSession failure should not prevent local cleanup.
      Driver should log warning but not throw to caller.

  - id: SESSION-013
    name: HTTP Retry on Transient Errors
    priority: Medium
    description: |
      Validates that driver automatically retries OpenSession when receiving
      transient HTTP errors with exponential backoff.

      Retryable HTTP status codes (per RetryHttpHandler.cs):
      - 408 Request Timeout
      - 429 Too Many Requests (uses RateLimitRetryTimeout)
      - 502 Bad Gateway
      - 503 Service Unavailable
      - 504 Gateway Timeout

      Retry behavior:
      - Uses Retry-After header if present, otherwise exponential backoff
      - Backoff starts at 1s, doubles each time (max 32s)
      - Adds jitter (80-120%) to avoid thundering herd
      - Retries until timeout exceeded:
        - TemporarilyUnavailableRetryTimeout (default 900s) for 408/502/503/504
        - RateLimitRetryTimeout (default 120s) for 429

    proxy_scenarios:
      - service_unavailable_503_open_session (HTTP 503)
      - request_timeout_408_open_session (HTTP 408)
      - bad_gateway_502_open_session (HTTP 502)
      - gateway_timeout_504_open_session (HTTP 504)
      - too_many_requests_429_open_session (HTTP 429)

    steps:
      - action: enable_failure_scenario
        scenario: <one_of_above>
        note: Scenario auto-disables after first error

      - action: execute_test
        description: Attempt to open session with transient error
        thrift_call: OpenSession

    assertions:
      - type: retry_with_backoff
        description: Driver waits ~1 second before retry (with jitter)

      - type: eventual_success
        description: Connection succeeds after retry

      - type: multiple_calls
        description: OpenSession called at least twice (initial + retry)

      - type: connection_valid
        description: Connection can execute queries

    notes: |
      Each proxy scenario returns error once then auto-disables, simulating
      transient errors that clear quickly.

      Tests validate automatic retry without manual intervention.

  - id: SESSION-014
    name: Concurrent Session Close
    priority: Low
    description: |
      Validates that driver handles multiple threads attempting to
      close the same session simultaneously.

    proxy_scenario: concurrent_session_close

    steps:
      - action: execute_test
        description: Open session, close from multiple threads
        concurrent_close_threads: 3

    assertions:
      - type: no_error
        description: No errors thrown from any thread

      - type: thrift_call_count
        method: CloseSession
        expected: 1
        description: Only one CloseSession call actually sent

    notes: |
      Driver should handle concurrent close gracefully with internal locking.

  - id: SESSION-015
    name: Keep-Alive During Long Result Fetching
    priority: High
    description: |
      Validates that driver sends periodic GetOperationStatus calls to keep
      the session alive during long-running result fetching operations.

      When fetching result sets that take a long time (e.g., via CloudFetch
      downloading large files from cloud storage), the driver automatically
      sends GetOperationStatus calls at regular intervals (configurable via
      adbc.databricks.fetch_heartbeat_interval, default 60s) to prevent
      session timeout while reading data.

      For testing, we configure a 5-second heartbeat interval and simulate a
      15-second result fetching operation to verify at least 3 GetOperationStatus
      calls are made (at t=0s, t=5s, t=10s).

    proxy_scenario: long_running_cloud_fetch
    jira: ES-1661289

    driver_config:
      fetch_heartbeat_interval_seconds: 5

    steps:
      - action: enable_failure_scenario
        scenario: long_running_cloud_fetch
        config:
          duration_seconds: 15  # Result fetching takes 15 seconds

      - action: execute_test
        description: Fetch results slowly and verify keep-alive calls
        execute_query: "SELECT * FROM large_table"
        fetch_all_results: true

    assertions:
      - type: no_error
        description: Result fetching completes successfully despite long duration

      - type: thrift_call_count
        method: GetOperationStatus
        expected: ">= 3"
        description: Driver sends at least 3 GetOperationStatus calls during 15s fetch (at 0s, 5s, 10s)

      - type: all_rows_fetched
        description: All result rows are successfully fetched

    notes: |
      The DatabricksOperationStatusPoller starts when the reader is created (after
      query execution completes and enters FINISHED state). It immediately makes
      the first GetOperationStatus call, then waits fetch_heartbeat_interval seconds
      before each subsequent call.

      With 5-second interval and 15-second operation:
      - t=0s: First GetOperationStatus (reader created)
      - t=5s: Second GetOperationStatus
      - t=10s: Third GetOperationStatus
      - t=15s: Operation completes

      This keep-alive mechanism is crucial for CloudFetch operations where large
      result sets take significant time to download from cloud storage (S3, Azure
      Blob, GCS).
